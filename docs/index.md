# Welcome to ReColonyzer

**Description**


ReColonyzer is a software to quantify the cell density of bacterial cultures
from timecourse pictures. It uses image analysis tools to determine the fitness
of spotted cultures of bacteria grown on solid agar, similarly to Colonyzer
([Lawless et al. 2010](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-11-287)), which has been a great inspiration for ReColonyzer.

ReColonyzer is very fast and robust, allowing the users to obtain reliable
resuls without the need to adjust a large number of parameters.
It performs well with bright as well as dark images, and it
is implemented as a Python3 package.
