# Welcome to BaColonyzer

**Description**


BaColonyzer is a software to quantify the cell density of bacterial cultures
from timecourse pictures. It uses image analysis tools to determine the fitness
of spotted cultures of bacteria grown on solid agar, similarly to what Colonyzer
does with yeast cultures
([Lawless et al. 2010](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-11-287)). Colonyzer has been a great inspiration for BaColonyzer.

BaColonyzer is very fast and robust, allowing the users to obtain reliable
resuls without the need to adjust a large number of parameters.
It performs well with bright as well as dark images, and it
is implemented as a Python3 package.
